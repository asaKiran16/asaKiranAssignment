    Markup language vs Scripting languages vs Programming languages 

-> Markup language

	- Markup languages are used to structure and format content on a webpage.
	- These are primarily used in web development.
	- Provide a low level of abstraction.
	- Markup languages use tags to define elements and their attributes. 

-> Scripting languages
	
	- These are used to control software applications and perform certain actions.
	- They are often used for tasks like web development, system administration, and automation. 
    -Scripting languages offer a higher level of abstraction.
	- JavaScript can be used to create dynamic behavior in web pages.
	- Scripting languages have more versatile syntax than markup languages. They include features like variables, conditionals, loops, functions, and more, which enable developers to create logic and automate tasks.

-> Programming languages 

	- Programming languages are used to create complex software applications by defining algorithms, logic, and detailed instructions.
	- Can be used for developing a wide range of applications, from desktop software to games and more.
	-Programming languages offer the highest level of abstraction.
	- Programming languages offer the richest syntax and features. They include all the elements of scripting languages but also provide more advanced features like object-oriented programming, memory management, and complex data structures.

    OOPS VS PP

-> OOPS (Object-oriented programming)
	~ In object-oriented programming, the program is divided into small parts called objects.
	~ Object-oriented programming follows a bottom-up approach.
	~ OOP gives importance to data rather than functions or procedures.

-> PP (Procedural Programming)
	~ In procedural programming, the program is divided into small parts called functions.
	~ Procedural programming follows a top-down approach.
	~ Procedural programming does not give importance to data.

    Features For JavaScript

	~ High-Level Language.
	~ Dynamic Typing.
	~ Prototype-Based Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
	~ Functional Style.
	~ Platform Independent.
	~ Prototype-based.
	~ Interpreted Language.
	~ Event-Driven.
	~ Client-Side Scripting: It can manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) to dynamically update content without requiring a page reload.
	~ Wide Range of Libraries and Frameworks.
	~ Standardization: JavaScript is standardized by the ECMAScript specification, which defines the language features and syntax. New versions, like ES6, ES7, etc., introduce enhanced capabilities and improved syntax.

   <!-- 
    Implementation of JavaScript

	~ Inline Scripting.
	~ External Script file.
	~ Asynchronous Loading. Done by using attributes called (async & defer).
	~ External Libraries and Frameworks.

	-> Remember that JavaScript is often used to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) to create dynamic interactions and update content on web pages. Make sure you're familiar with the DOM API to effectively use JavaScript in web development.

        History of JavaScript

	~ Birth of JavaScript (1995).
	~ JavaScript Standardization (1996-1997).
		- The standardization process resulted in the ECMAScript specification, with the first edition published in June 1997.
	~ Browser Wars and DOM Manipulation (Late 1990s - Early 2000s).
	~ AJAX and Web 2.0 (Early 2000s). - "AJAX" (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML).
	~ Modernization and Frameworks (2010s).
		- The introduction of HTML5, CSS3, and newer versions of ECMAScript (ES5, ES6, etc.) brought significant improvements to the language and its capabilities.
		- JavaScript frameworks and libraries, such as jQuery, Angular, React, and Vue.js, gained popularity, making it easier to build complex web applications.
	~ Server-Side JavaScript (Node.js)(2009) - This allowed applications to work on both the client and server side. 
	~ Continued Evolution (2020s) - Introducing new features and enhancements. This includes features like async/await, arrow functions, class syntax, and more.
	-> Microsoft also developed a scripting language called "JScript" for Internet Explorer.
